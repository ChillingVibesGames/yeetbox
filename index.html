    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>
      Enter JavaScript into the text box to generate a level.
      <br>
      <br>
      Things you can change:
      <br>
      LEVELWIDTH: The width of the level, in pixels. Default is 16384.
      <br>
      LEVELHEIGHT: The height of the level, in pixels. Default is 16384.
      <br>
      terrain: Must be a list of objects returned by createTerrainData(). All objects passed to createTerrainData must have properties "x", "y", "width", "height". The createTerrainData function adds a "render" property, which is necessary to render them. See the on how to do this. By default, the level is empty.
      <br>
      RESPAWNX: The x coordinate, in pixels, where the player will respawn. Default is 0.
      <br>
      RESPAWNY: The y coordinate, in pixels, where the player will respawn. Default is 0.
      <br>
      <br>
      Controls:
      <br>
      Space - jump
      <br>
      Left and right arrows: move left and right
      <br>
      X - regenerate level and respawn (more useful for dynamic or random levels)
      <br>
      Ctrl+C - Reload (idk why I did this, but if you find it useful, good for you)
      <br>
      <br>
      Rules:
      <br>
      You can wall jump - just press up against a wall and press Space.
      <br>
      If you fall off a platform without jumping, you can jump once in the air. You can then only wall jump until you land. If you jump off a platform, you cannot jump in the air. However, you can still wall jump. You can wall jump anytime.
      <br>
      If you fall to the bottom of the level, you will respawn. The level will not regenerate when this happens.
